# Emacs - Dotfile and Themes

## Dotfile

All my emacs configuration. I used [Bewmacs](https://github.com/joebew42/bewmacs) as a base for my actual .emacs file. 

Really wanna thanks @JoeBew42 for introduce myself on Emacs while watching his stream on Twitch.

## Themes

The main theme of my .emacs file is a copy of the [Jonathan Blow](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow?) emacs theme. 

Other themes has little changes from the original, recommend you to check the original repositories:
- [DarkPlus](https://github.com/dunstontc/darkplus-emacs)
- [Darkula](https://github.com/fourier/idea-darkula-theme)
- [IntelliJ](https://gitlab.com/fommil/emacs-intellij-theme)
- [Spacegray](https://github.com/nhunzaker/spacegray-emacs)
